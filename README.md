# dkNN

This repository contains the code and experiments to test the quality, efficiency of an implementation to kNN that optimises the number of neighbours per class instead of globaly, therefore being theoretically similar to having multiple binary kNN classifiers, one per class. This solution has the same complexity of the multi-label kNN, though.
